Types of API:
1. Public API - These are the APIs that are available to general public, good rule is user must sign up for API that they want to use. And then the system should provide them access to make the requests for API.
2. Private API - These are the APIs which are exposed within the company only. Team can take advantage of this API to make a robust system.
